🚀 Successfully Set Up GitLab → GitHub Repository Mirroring!

Today, I explored how to automate repository synchronization between GitLab and GitHub — ensuring any push made to my GitLab project is instantly reflected on GitHub.

Here’s what I did 👇
✅ Created repositories on both GitLab (mirror-repo-gtlab) and GitHub (mirror-repo-github)
✅ Generated a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) for secure authentication
✅ Configured repository mirroring in GitLab to push updates automatically to GitHub
✅ Verified synchronization — new commits and files pushed to GitLab were mirrored perfectly on GitHub 🎯

This setup is great for:
💡 Maintaining code redundancy
💡 Collaborating across different platforms
💡 Showcasing open-source work on multiple platforms

🛠️ Tools used: GitLab | GitHub | Git | Personal Access Tokens

📸 Screenshots below show the complete workflow — from repo creation to successful mirroring!
